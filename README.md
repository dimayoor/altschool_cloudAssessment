# 3MTT Cloud Engineering â€“ Beginner Module Assessment 
I created two Virtual Machine (VM): one is the main and the other one is the slave. 

I successfully setup a the second server (the slave VM) and added the IP Address of the host file to the main VM

The bash script was created and executed to trigger the Cronjob

I performed a ping operation using the host file
